# traffic_fines
## Objective
The aim of this project is to demonstrate some ways of optimizing database performance. Some of the techniques used in this project include
1. Indices
:even though they can be a great way of optimizing database performance, care must be taken in its usage as having too many indices on database tables can undesireably increase the cost of database operations (inserts and updates).
3. Denormalization
Denormalization can significantly increase database performance but the is also a cost associated with it. Denormalization introduces data redundancy as same data may be stored in the other places.

In all, it is important to consider the task at hand and decide carefully a balanced usage of these optimization techniques.
